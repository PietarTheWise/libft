## DISCLAIMER

<p>
This is a project from the 42 school, which is a school that utilizes peer to peer learning.
We're only given a document that gives us the details of the assignment, therefore each implementation
is unique. Each assignment is tested for crashes and other bugs thoroughly by other peers.
